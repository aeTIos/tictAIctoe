# tictAIctoe

This bot was written as a group effort for an assignment during a Python course. 
The `trainingframework.py` was provided by the guy giving the course and edited a little to fit our bot. 

**How to run**
- run `init-db.py`
- run `trainingframework.py`

Requirements:
Python 3.6

**How it works**

The basic concept of the workings of the bot are explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9c-_neaxeU) by the excellent Matt Parker. We translated the concept to code and in its current state it is a pretty accurate reflection of the Menace machine.
